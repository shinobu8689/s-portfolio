# Requirement 4


<h1>Title:
Super Mario Bros üî¥ üü¢</h1>

**Description**:
- Add a menu before the map to select the main player to be Luigi or Mario üéÆ
- Both characters will have 3 lives in their stats and the game restarts every time they lose a life ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
- the game will end when player loses all lives üíîüíîüíî
- Luigi has the unique trait of an extra life added when he begins the game while mario only has 3 ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüíî

**Explanation why it adheres to SOLID principles** (WHY):
- adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle as Luigi and Mario as two separate classes that extend the player class and each have their own responsibilities and traits when selected by the player
- Open-Close principle because both Luigi and Mario extend player and altering one will not alter the other
- Have a Lives interface that is implemented by both Mario and Luigi which adheres to Liskov Substitution principle since Luigi's special trait is more lives than mario

# Requirement 5

<h1>Title: 
Power ups! üëäüèª</h1>

**Description**:

- New Blind Status that limited player vision (Fog of war). Can choose on the menu for higher difficulty.
  - Any new updates on the map will show for 1 turn then it will be masked.
  - Special character will not be affected by the Blind effect
  
- More effects/status for Player and enemies for a more dynamic gameplay.
  - Effect will be capabilities which checks for every player in each turn.
  - Effects that obtain from enemies:
    1) Dizzy: Actor walks randomly for a few turns until he wakes up.
    2) Burnt: Actor takes extra damage every turn, the longer it stands on lava, the longer the effects will cool down, and more damage to the player as well.
  - Effects that randomly obtain from the 3rd fountain "Miracle Fountain" ('V'):
    1) Shield: Actor will have a shield that has 90% chance to block any damage, once attack is blocked the shield breaks.  
    2) Blessed: Actor take half damage in 5 turns. 


**Explanation why it adheres to SOLID principles** (WHY):

- Open-Close Principle: Different effects given from the water are extended from "StandardWater" so it is open to add more types of Water power ups just by extending it. And all subclass water types can benefit from the modification of the base "StandardWater" class.
- Single Responsibility Principle: Each water type are different class to only focus on its responsibility. The masking mechanism will operate inside Maskable interface itself.
- Dependency Inversion Principle: "StandardWater" is an abstract concept and its subclass are the details.
- Liskov Substitution Principle: Should be able to use any sub-water types where StandardWater is excepted.
